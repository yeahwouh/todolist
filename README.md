# webpack-template

This project was created from [yeahwouh/webpack-template](https://link-url-here.org) so I don't need to set up webpack every time. This containe following implementations:
-  HTML-loader
-  style-loader/CSS-loader
-  HTML Webpack plugin
  
You will need to comment out .gitignore
